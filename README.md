# Wiki Command

IsleWard - Wiki Command does what its name states; it adds a command to access and search the IsleWard wiki from inside the game.

## Features

- `/wiki` opens the IsleWard wiki homepage.
- `/wiki article` searches for a wiki article named `article`. If a match is found, the corresponding page is opened. If no match is found, a page with related search results is shown.

## Installation

The installation procedure is different, depending on whether one is playing using a browser, or on the [IsleWard client](https://gitlab.com/Isleward/desktop-client).

- #### Client
  Refer to [this link](https://gitlab.com/Isleward/desktop-client#how-do-i-load-addons).
- #### Browser
  Install [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/). Then, install the `wiki.js` file as a script in ViolentMonkey.

## FAQs

- #### Will this affect other players?
  No, this is an entirely client-side addon. Only the user will be able to see the command and the page that is opened.

- #### What about performance and memory usage?
  Not a problem.
